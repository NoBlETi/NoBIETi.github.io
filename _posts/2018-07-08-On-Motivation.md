A year ago I've started a business. We (Me and my cofounder) are building a SaaS platform to help businesses improve their cyber security posture. How, and What is a topic for another day.

## Today I want to talk to myself about motivation. 
It seems I have bad weeks, and good weeks... everyone has that, but I don't like it. 

Yes I know, there are always up's and down's and being high and low is just another symptom. I don't mind having a lazy day, were I lack motivation, but __there must be a way of discovering that the day is coming and stopping it__ or at least shortening it to a day, or two... not a fucken week.

I usually get stack and start playing games, watching TV shows, or just getting angry that I'm not doing anything. Not very useful. 

At the moment to fight with it I watch "motivational" channels on YouTube, like GaryVee or Word Porn, or something similar. It helps a little bit, nut not in full. There is always this feeling, the feeling that you are so close to doing, something, or remembering something but it's just that one step away, just around the corner! You know what I mean?

This is what I'm trying to fight at the moment. We will see how it goes. 

I feel, I'm almost there!
